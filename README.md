# Frontend quiz app

![Design preview for the Frontend quiz app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a web-based quiz application that tests users' knowledge of front-end development across four different topics. It was developed as the final challenge in the "JavaScript Fundamentals" course on Frontend Mentor.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Styled Components for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Desktop-first workflow
- Context API + Reducer pattern for state management

### What I learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of React and explore advanced state management techniques. Here are some key learnings:

1. **Advanced State Management**: I challenged myself by avoiding React Router and instead implementing a state-based navigation system using Context API and a reducer function. This approach allowed me to create a conditional rendering system for components based on the application's state.

2. **Custom Theming**: I implemented a dark/light mode theme from scratch, which was a first for me. This involved creating a global theme provider and managing theme state across the entire application.

3. **Styled Components**: I delved deeper into the capabilities of Styled Components, learning how to create dynamic styles based on component props and application state.

4. **Animation with Framer Motion**: To enhance the user experience, I incorporated animations using Framer Motion, which added a layer of polish to the UI.

5. **Thinking in React**: This project reinforced the importance of breaking down the UI into a component hierarchy, identifying the minimal set of app state, and determining which components should own what state.

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to focus on:

- Implementing TypeScript for improved type safety and code robustness
- Adding a timer feature to increase the challenge of the quiz
- Exploring more efficient ways to implement theming in React applications
- Further optimizing performance, especially for larger applications

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation was invaluable for understanding core concepts and best practices.
- [Styled Components Documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs) - This helped me grasp the full potential of CSS-in-JS and how to create dynamic, reusable styled components.
- [Framer Motion Documentation](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - An excellent resource for learning how to add smooth animations to React components.
- [Kent C. Dodds' Blog](https://kentcdodds.com/blog) - Kent's articles on advanced React patterns, including the use of Context and Reducers, were extremely helpful.
